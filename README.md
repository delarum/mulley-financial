# MULLEY FINANCIAL 
This is a capstone project showcasing the layout of a real life financial consulting landing page. The company itself is advertising its secrives through this landing page by offering an array of financial services. Its target market in mind is mostly Corporate Organizations, Startups and the common citizen in need of financial assistance or advice.  

## DESCRIPTION
A landing page containing most of the components i have picked up over the past few weeks and being fully responsive, I believe it embodies a page that is easy to navigate escpecially from the consumers point of view.

It is equiped with:
 - A resposive functional navbar
 - A minimal but gravitating topography that is including; use of colors that blend harmoniuosly, a readable professional font, use of images and animated card sections.
 - A pop up modal in the get started that is mainly the center of the happy path since the goal is to get customers to contact us wanting to use the services we offer.
 - Functional and Customized forms to fill out.
 - Real world funcionality including 
 compatibility of the content in the landing page to the purpose of the company itself.
 - Responsive links in the page
 - Improved styling and use of hover effects on cards, images and textareas.
